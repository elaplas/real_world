# Problem 5
## Decisions
The problem is solved using a linked list namely a "stack". If the pointer of the top of the list is kept, the insertion time complexity becomes O(1) and the previous node can be easily accessed. 
## Time efficiency
- The insertion of a block in the blockchain: O(1)
- Walking through the blockchain: O(n)
## Space efficiency
The length of chain: O(n)
